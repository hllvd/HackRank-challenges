An arcade game player wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and track their ranking. The game uses Dense Ranking, so its leaderboard works like this:
<br/>
The player with the highest score is ranked number 1 on the leaderboard.
Players who have equal scores receive the same ranking number, and the next player(s) receive the immediately following ranking number.
<br/>
ranked = [100,90,90,80]<br/>
payer = [70,80,105]

The ranked players will have ranks 1,2,2 and respectively. If the player's scores are 70, 80 and 105, their rankings after each game are 4, 3 and 1. Return [4,3,1].
